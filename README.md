So to plot correlation function we have to go through some multiple steps

1) First find features of a single frame with featuresize 7(Should work for Bidispersed spheres). 
2) Plot this and see if you are getting right results or not.
3) Find the features of all the frames.
4) Link them.
5) Find correlation plots.
